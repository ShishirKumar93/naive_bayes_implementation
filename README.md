# naive_bayes_implementation
Python implementation from scratch - Naive Bayes

Here, I implement multinomial naive bayes classifier to predict whether a movie review is positive or negative. I have used a large collection of positive and negative sentiment reviews in the [polarity dataset](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data) to train the classification model.

All the classes and functions can be found in file bayes.py. File test_bayes.py has tests designed to validate the implementation.

Thanks to Prof. [Terence Parr](https://github.com/parrt) for his guidance and support in this school project.
