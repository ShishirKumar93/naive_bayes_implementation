# naive_bayes_implementation
Python implementation from scratch - Naive Bayes

Here, we implement multinomial naive bayes classifier to predict whether a movie review is positive or negative. We have a large collection of positive and negative sentiment reviews in the polarity dataset, which will be loaded, processed and used to train the classification model.

All the classes and functions can be found in file bayes.py. File test_bayes.py has tests designed to validate the implementation.
